        <h1>FACTS</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Orangutan are the largest of the great apes, sharing 97% of DNA with humans.</li>
            <li>In the Malay language, orangutan means "person of the forest".</li>
            <li>Orangutans can be found living in the lowland forests, where the species feast on
                mainly ripe fruits, greens, and some insects as snacks.
            </li>
            <li>They are the most solitary of all the great apes.</li>
            <li>They have the slowest life histories of any mammals. They are the slowest to grow up
                and reproduce.
            </li>
            <li>Orangutans have opposable thumbs and big toes.</li>
            <li>When male orangutan reach mature age, they develop large cheekpads that attract mates.</li>
            <li>Orangutans' arms are longer than their body when it is stretched out. When on ground,
                they all on all fours.
            </li>
            <li>They live in only two places in the world: Borneo and Sumatra in South East Asia.</li>
            <li>Each night, orangutan makes a new nest in the trees where they can sleep. Sometimes,
                they'll build a nest for themselves!
            </li>
            <li>For the first year of an infant's life, they will cling to their mothers and learn
                everything from her.
            </li>
            <li>Orangutans are extremely intelligent, as they have been observed to make tools for
                scratching, foraging food, and using leaves as gloves to pick up spiny fruit
                and branches.
            </li>
        </ul>
